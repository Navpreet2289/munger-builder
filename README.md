# munger-builder

A tool for generating python scripts to do data munging (for now mostly pivot tables), using a javascript GUI

Still a work in progress, and may be very broken. Stay tuned for updates.

The "script-building" functionality is not built yet, but there is a way to run a pre-built munging script to execute your munger directly on the server.
